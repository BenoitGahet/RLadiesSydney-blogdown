Welcome to the first unit of [RYouWithMe](/courses/workshop/_index/)! In this first unit, you'll lay down the foundational knowledge and skills that will carry you through your R journey! Since it covers the basics of R in a hopefully straightforward way, we're calling it *Basic Basics*...

This unit has three lessons:

1. [An opinionated tour of RStudio](/courses/workshop/01-BasicBasics-1/)
2. [Installing and loading packages](/courses/workshop/01-BasicBasics-2/)
3. [Getting data into RStudio](/courses/workshop/01-BasicBasics-3/)

Click on any of the links above to see the lessons. As you embark on Basic Basics, we think this is a useful reminder for R users new and experienced (h/t [realpython](twitter.com/realpython)):

Learning R is a journey - we're delighted to have you along!
