<p>Learning something new on your own is hard! So lets meet up and learn new R things together.</p>
<p>Each month we get together to meet up, shut up (talking is allowed if you are seeking/getting help), and code.</p>
<p>Modelled on the academic writing #ShutUpAndWrite movement (<a href="https://thesiswhisperer.com/shut-up-and-write/" class="uri">https://thesiswhisperer.com/shut-up-and-write/</a>), the idea is make learning social.</p>
<p>There are only 10 places available at each session, so ONLY RSVP if you are SURE you will come. Please do not take a place from another RLady, and then not turn up.</p>
<p>Check out our <a href="https://www.meetup.com/rladies-sydney/">Meetup page</a> to see if there is a ShutUpAndCode session scheduled soon</p>
