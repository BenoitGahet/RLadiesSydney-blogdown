Learning something new on your own is hard! So lets meet up and learn new R things together.

Each month we get together to meet up, shut up (talking is allowed if you are seeking/getting help), and code.

Modelled on the academic writing #ShutUpAndWrite movement (https://thesiswhisperer.com/shut-up-and-write/), the idea is make learning social.

There are only 10 places available at each session, so ONLY RSVP if you are SURE you will come. Please do not take a place from another RLady, and then not turn up.

Check out our [Meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-sydney/) to see if there is a ShutUpAndCode session scheduled soon
