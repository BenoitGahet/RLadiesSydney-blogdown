R-Ladies events online are a new challenge for us in the time of COVID-19. We were a bit scared to run workshop type events online so decided to go low stakes and start a new series called Show and Tell. 


At Show and Tell events, members can turn up with some code that they are proud of (or some code that is driving them crazy) and share it with others. 

Here are links to some tips and tricks (and really impressive transport maps) shared by R-Ladies Sydney members at the May event. 

1. [ggplot tricks](https://rpubs.com/jenrichmond/jenny_sloane_ggplot) by Jenny Sloane


2. [dplyr tricks](https://rpubs.com/jenrichmond/st_dplyr) and using R to [analyse how spending patterns have changed](https://rpubs.com/jenrichmond/bank) since lockdown by Jen Richmond. 


3. [Belinda](@Surgisse) was prepping a talk about using leaflet to make amazing maps of transport data. Her talk was awesome and you can watch [the whole thing here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1t7l4y5fm3mKfqGBk8iv-kO57w896Gmug/view?usp=sharing)
