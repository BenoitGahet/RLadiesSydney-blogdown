Our June Show and Tell was another great showcase of all great things Tidyverse. 

1. John Ormond showed us how he has used `gganimate` to teach students how principal components analysis works. [John's code is available here](https://rpubs.com/jormerod/594859)

2. Jenny Sloane shared a series of tips and tricks for making working in R easier. [Check out Jenny's tips and tricks here](http://rpubs.com/jsloane/623159) 

3. Rachel Mak made a `shiny` app that allows you to zoom in on part of a ggplot (and then showed us how Python actually does it better- code to come)

4. Jen Richmond showed us a few different ways to get data into R (`googlesheets4` and `datapasta`), some ggplot tips for visualising points (`ggbeeswarm` and `ggeasy`) and some RMarkdown magic for getting ggplot exported to png. Check out [her code here](https://rpubs.com/jenrichmond/st_ggplot).

5. Kristy Robledo showed us how to use the `flextable` package to make beautiful tables in RMarkdown that knit REALLY nicely to word. She has a [blog post here](https://kristyrobledo.netlify.app/post/beautiful-tables-in-word-using-rmarkdown/) that walks you through how to use this great package!. 

thanks to everyone who shared- it was SUPER fun!
